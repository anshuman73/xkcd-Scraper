# How to Use


Download and Save the scraper.py in a folder.

Use the terminal and type `python scraper.py`

The program will automatically create a folder "images" in the directory from which the script is run and save all the images in that.

**For Windows you may have to download Python first from [Python.org](http://python.org). Make sure you download Python 2.7.x**
